## üí° Information
> This is **not** a production-ready application. It is an application made for a very specific purpose. This is also not a plug-and-play solution. You will need to modify the code to fit your needs and environment.

> You will need to develop a solution to update your current location. This can be done using a GPS module or a mobile device with GPS capabilities. You will also need to develop a solution to send the current location to the server. This can be done using a mobile app or a web app.
